#Representation of numbers

Computers operate on nothing more than zeros and ones.  This tutorial explains how they are able to represent integers and floating point numbers this way, and explains some of the details of the limitations of floating point.

#Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.  In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor. Windows has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
